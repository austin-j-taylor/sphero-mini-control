# sphero-mini-control

A program for connecting to a Sphero mini using a Raspberry Pi and a bluetooth or USB controller.
Warning: hacky. The contents of the pyjoycon folder should be moved to override the contents of your pyjoycon installation in order to add the Switch Pro controller. There's probably a much smarter way to do this, but I unfortunately didn't care enough to figure it out.
